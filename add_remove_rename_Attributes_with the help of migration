######add attributes by generate migration 
  # first we need to create a migration ....Example ---$ rails g migration add_attributes_to_tablename
after done these think to open migrate file where last migration is present so inside migration file 
have change method it referse to chang anything in the table and inside 
change method present create_table method it will take 3 argument .1-table name,2- column name and 
3 -datatype of the column

class AddAddressCrecketer < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_column :cricketers(table_name), :address(Column name), :string(datatype)
    add_column :cricketers, :dob, :date
    add_column :cricketers, :age, :integer
  end
end


###### Remove column by using migration 
    Every thing is same as add columns but inside chage method have a remove_column method

-->class RemoveColumnToProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    remove_column :cricketers(table_name), :total_run(column name)
  end
end-->

#####  Rename
class RenameColumnToCrickers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    rename_column :cricketers, :age, :date_of_birth
    #Ex:- rename_column("admin_users", "pasword","hashed_pasword")
