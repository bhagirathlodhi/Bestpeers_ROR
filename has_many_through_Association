A has_many :through association is often used to set up a many-to-many connection with another model. 
This association indicates that the declaring model can be matched with zero or more instances of
another model by proceeding through a third model. 

class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :physicians, through: :appointments

end


class Physician < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :patients, through: :appointments
end


class Appointment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :physician
  belongs_to :patient
end


class CreateAppointments < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :physicians do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :patients do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :appointments do |t|
      t.belongs_to :physician
      t.belongs_to :patient
      t.datetime :appointment_date
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
